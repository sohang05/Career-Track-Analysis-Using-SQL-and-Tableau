# Career Track Analysis Using SQL & Tableau

## Case Description

One of the functionalities the 365 company introduced in a 2021 platform release included the option 
for student enrollment in a career track. The tracks represent an ordinal sequence of courses that 
eventually lead to obtaining the skills for one of three job titles: data scientist, data analyst, 
or business analyst.

Completing a career track on the platform is a challenging task. To acquire a corresponding career 
certificate, a student must pass nine course exams (seven compulsory and two elective courses) and
sit for a career track exam encompassing topics from all seven required courses.

In this Career Track Analysis with SQL and Tableau project, you’re tasked with analyzing the career 
track enrollments and achievements of 365’s students. You’ll first need to retrieve the necessary 
information from an SQL database. Afterward, you’ll feed this information to Tableau, visualize the 
results, and finally interpret them.

## Project requirements

* MySQL Workbench 8.0
* Tableau 2022 or newer.

## Career Contents

* **Part 1 : Extracting the Data with SQL**
In this task we have to analyze the career track enrollments and completions of 365’s students.
We need to retrieve the necessary information from an SQL database. Afterwards, we feed this
information to Tableau and visualize the results.

* **Part 2 : Creating a Combo Chart in Tableau**
For this part of the project, we need to open Tableau and feed it the data source we retrieved in
the previous part. Our task is to create a combo chart—a bar chart overlaid with a line chart.
Each bar should represent a given month, while their height should represent the number of track
enrollments that month (This is not the same as the number of students who’ve enrolled in a track.)

* **Part 3 : Creating a Bar Chart in Tableau**
Now we create a new worksheet containing a bar chart with each bar representing a different completion
bucket and their height corresponding to the number of track enrollments completed in the respective time.

* **Part 4: Interpreting the Results**
Analyzing the study results and drawing meaningful conclusions is essential.

Consider the Tableau visualizations we have created and answer the following questions:  

1.What is the number of enrolled students monthly? Which is the month with the most enrollments? 
Speculate about the reason for the increased numbers.
2.Which career track do students enroll most in?
3.What is the career track completion rate? Can you say if it’s increasing, decreasing, or staying
constant with time?
4.How long does it typically take students to complete a career track? What type of subscription is 
most suitable for students who aim to complete a career track: monthly, quarterly, or annual?
5.What advice and suggestions for improvement would you give the 365 team to boost engagement, increase
the track completion rate, and motivate students to learn more consistently?
