# Interpreting the Results

1. What is the number of enrolled students monthly? Which is the month with the most enrollments? Speculate about the reason for the increased numbers.

The number of monthly career track enrollments and the fraction of students who complete the track—not necessarily within the month of enrollment.Studying the height of 
the bars, we observe a fluctuating number of people enrolling monthly (roughly 800 and 1,200), with August registering a higher number. The reason is a campaign that 365
ran for three days which gave all its students free access to the platform. We can see that this has both boosted the number of enrollments and, as a result, the completion
rate. Still, most people enrolled in this period seem to have started the track but have given up once the free days ended.

2. Which career track do students enroll most in?

When considering the number of enrolled students per track, the data analyst career track is the most sought after among 365 students, followed by the data science track 
and, finally, the business analyst one.

3. What is the career track completion rate? Can you say if it’s increasing, decreasing, or staying constant with time?

Studying the line part of the combo chart, we see the numbers fluctuating. But the passing rate (around 2%) is relatively low, with numbers varying between tracks. 
Therefore, it’s difficult to state any dependency with time—i.e., we can’t conclude with certainty the completion rate increases, decreases, or stays constant.

4. How long does it typically take students to complete a career track? What type of subscription is most suitable for students who aim to complete a career track: monthly, quarterly, or annual?

We can argue, that students need a lot of time to complete an entire career track. This claim is supported by the second bar chart created in the project, where we’ve seen that it takes students
an annual subscription to complete a single career track. Such an analysis should therefore be conducted for long periods. The SQL database shows that the last completion date recorded is May 16, 2023.If we assume that it takes roughly a year for students to complete a track, then people registered towards the end of the period under analysis have yet to complete theirs.

5. What advice and suggestions for improvement would you give the 365 team to boost engagement, increase the track completion rate, and motivate students to learn more consistently? 

Given the relatively low success rate of 2% in completing a career track, we can appreciate how much effort, engagement, and persistence it requires to complete one. Students need to complete nine courses, pass nine course exams, and the career track itself—encompassing topics from all seven compulsory courses entering the track. We understand that this can make students feel overwhelmed and discouraged.
