# Interpreting the Results

1. What is the number of enrolled students monthly? Which is the month with the most enrollments? Speculate about the reason for the increased numbers.

The number of monthly career track enrollments and the fraction of students who complete the trackâ€”not necessarily within the month of enrollment.Studying the height of 
the bars, we observe a fluctuating number of people enrolling monthly (roughly 800 and 1,200), with August registering a higher number. The reason is a campaign that 365
ran for three days which gave all its students free access to the platform. We can see that this has both boosted the number of enrollments and, as a result, the completion
rate. Still, most people enrolled in this period seem to have started the track but have given up once the free days ended.
